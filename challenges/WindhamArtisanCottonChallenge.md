Fabric Challenge quilts must use at least 3 of the 6 challenge fabrics — no other fabrics may be used on the front of the quilts.
If the binding is visible from the front of the quilt, it must be in one of the palette fabrics — the backing may be any fabric. If the quilt is faced and does not have binding that appears on the front of the quilt, the facing can be of any fabric.
Size restrictions follow the same standard as all QuiltCon quilts — there is no minimum size — there is a maximum of 440″ total perimeter (with no single side larger than 110″).
Quilt entries will be open from September 1 to October 31, 2023 (the same as all QuiltCon show entries).
